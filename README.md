Piga Console
============

This is the official repository for the piga source code. The piga project 
is aimed to create a new arcade console together with its own games using 
a Raspberry Pi and some arcade buttons in combination with arcade joysticks
and some programs written for the linux operating system. 

Currently, the piga library and the console are in a pre-alpha stage. When 
there are more actual pictures to show off, then this page will be expanded.
