Piga Console {#mainpage}
============

[![Build Status](http://root.maximaximal.com/jenkins/buildStatus/icon?job=Piga&build=27)](http://root.maximaximal.com/jenkins/job/Piga/27/)

This is the official repository for the piga source code. The piga project 
is aimed to create a new arcade console together with its own games using 
a Raspberry Pi and some arcade buttons in combination with arcade joysticks
and some programs written for the linux operating system. 

Currently, the piga library and the console are in a pre-alpha stage. When 
there are more actual pictures to show off, then this page will be expanded.

This page was made to be viewed from within the doxygen documentation. The links
are generated by doxygen and put together in the final documentation page. Please 
view the [pre-generated documentation](http://root.maximaximal.com/jenkins/job/Piga/doxygen/) if 
you want to view the full range of piga docs.
