Piga Console Host (PiGaCo)
==========================

The Piga Host application (short: PiGaCo) provides the necessary environment
for piga games. This application hosts the piga::Host class and sets
the internal inputs and shared memory constructs used by the libpiga library.

This application also implements a visual game selection screen to select
the game which is going to be played. The GUI is implemented using the piHUD
library to provide a direct mapping of the native input methods 
(joystick and buttons).

The source code of this application can be found on GitHub:
